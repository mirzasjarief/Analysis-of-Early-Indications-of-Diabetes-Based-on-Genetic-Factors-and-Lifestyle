## Description
The main goal is early detection to prevent diabetes, focusing on genetic factors and lifestyle habits. The target is to reduce the risk of early-stage diabetes by 95% within the next six months. Educating patients on healthy eating habits, the importance of regular exercise, and quitting harmful habits like smoking can significantly lower the likelihood of developing advanced diabetes or related complications.

To address the main goal above, this project focuses on statistical analysis, specifically descriptive and inferential analysis, including visual analytics, correlation tests, A/B testing, and hypothesis testing.

## Problem Breakdown

To simplify the analysis and address the issue effectively, we need to understand the core details of the problem. To achieve this, we will use the Key Questions method by breaking the problem into six main questions:

1. Do patients with a family history of diabetes have a higher risk of developing diabetes compared to those without a family history?
2. Who has the highest diabetes rates based on HbA1c blood sugar levels, men or women?
3. Does the risk of developing diabetes increase with age?
4. Is there a significant difference in HbA1c (blood sugar cells) levels between smokers and non-smokers?
5. Are diet and exercise linked to diagnosis results?
6. What is the correlation between Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) levels and HbA1c in detecting diabetes, and how does it relate to lifestyle?

## Basic Data Information


This dataset consists of 100+ health records of patients collected from various sources, including medical records, surveys, and interviews. The data has been cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy and completeness.

#### Context
Detecting the potential for early-stage diabetes, preventing advanced-stage diabetes, and chronic complications based on genetic factors and lifestyle habits. All relevant information pertains to preventing diabetes progression or complications.

#### Content
Demographic information about patients, including age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, family history of diabetes, diagnosis, and all health records related to early diabetes detection and prevention of advanced diabetes and its complications.

#### Columns

Age: Patient's age, in years.
Gender: Patient's gender, male or female.
BMI: Body mass index, in kg/m².
Blood Pressure: Patient's blood pressure status, categorized as low, normal, or high.
FBS: Fasting Blood Sugar (blood sample taken after an 8-hour fast), in mg/dL.
HbA1c: Glycated hemoglobin, reflecting average blood sugar levels over the past 2–3 months.
Family History of Diabetes: Family history of diabetes.
Smoking: Whether the patient is a smoker or non-smoker.
Diet: Patient's dietary habits, categorized as healthy or poor.
Exercise: Whether the patient exercises regularly or not.
Diagnosis: Whether the patient is positive for diabetes or not.
