## Description
The main goal is early detection to prevent diabetes, focusing on genetic factors and lifestyle habits. The target is to reduce the risk of early-stage diabetes by 95% within the next six months. Educating patients on healthy eating habits, the importance of regular exercise, and quitting harmful habits like smoking can significantly lower the likelihood of developing advanced diabetes or related complications.

To address the main goal above, this project focuses on statistical analysis, specifically descriptive and inferential analysis, including visual analytics, correlation tests, A/B testing, and hypothesis testing.
